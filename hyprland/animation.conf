    # BEZIER CURVES - The heart of the animation style.
    # We define a few key curves and reuse them for consistency.
    # You can visualize and create your own at https://cubic-bezier.com/
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # A smooth, decelerating curve. Perfect for things that "arrive," like opening a window.
    bezier = gentleOut, 0.4, 0, 0.2, 1

    # A swift, accelerating curve. Good for things that "depart," like closing a window.
    bezier = swiftIn, 0.4, 0, 0.6, 1

    # A standard "ease in and out" curve. Ideal for transitions like workspace changes.
    bezier = smooth, 0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1

    # A slightly bouncy curve for a touch of flair. Use sparingly.
    bezier = overshot, 0.18, 0.89, 0.32, 1.28

    # ANIMATION RULES - Applying the curves to desktop elements.
    # Format: animation = [ELEMENTS], [ENABLED], [SPEED_ms], [CURVE], [STYLE]
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # Global animation for things not specified below.
    # Keep it simple and relatively fast.
    animation = global, 1, 7, default

    # Windows
    # Windows glide into place when opened and slide away when moved.

    animation = windowsIn, 1, 6, gentleOut, slide
    animation = windowsOut, 1, 5, swiftIn, slide

    # Borders
    # A quick, subtle animation when a window becomes active.
    animation = border, 1, 10, smooth
    animation = borderangle, 1, 18, smooth

    # Fades
    # A gentle fade-in for new windows.
    animation = fadeIn, 1, 5, gentleOut
    animation = fadeOut, 1, 5, swiftIn

    # Workspaces
    # A very smooth and clear slide animation for workspace changes.
    # This is a key part of the "feel."
    animation = workspaces, 1, 6, smooth, slide

    # Special Workspaces (Scratchpads)
    # Make scratchpads feel like they are dropping down from the top.
    animation = specialWorkspace, 1, 6, gentleOut, slidevert

    # Layers (for UI elements like wofi or notifications)
    # Have them fade in and out smoothly.
